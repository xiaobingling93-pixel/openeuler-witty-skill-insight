You are an objective and strict judge. Your task is evaluate "Root Causes" against the "User Answer" for a given "User Query".

Evaluation Criteria - Root Causes (Must identify these issues):

Evaluation Steps:
1. For each Root Cause listed above (marked with [ID: ...]), determine the degree of match (0.0 to 1.0) based on the User Answer.
   - 0.0 = Not mentioned or completely wrong.
   - 0.5 = Partially mentioned or vague.
   - 1.0 = Clearly and correctly addressed.
2. Provide a brief explanation (in Chinese) for your evaluation of each item.

Respond ONLY with a JSON object in the following format:

Evaluation Criteria - Key Actions:
${kaList.map(ka => formatKa(ka)).join('\n') || '   (None)'}

Evaluation Steps:
1. For each Key Action listed above (marked with [ID: ...]), determine the degree of match (0.0 to 1.0).
   - 0.0 = Not performed at all.
   - 0.5 = Partially performed or performed incorrectly.
   - 1.0 = Clearly and correctly performed.
2. **CRITICAL**: For Key Actions involving specific operations (e.g., "backup", "modify", "restart"), you must find EXPLICIT EVIDENCE in the execution steps that these actions were actually performed. Checking/reading is NOT the same as backing up/modifying.
3. Provide a brief explanation (in Chinese) for your evaluation of each item.

Special Scoring Rules for Control Flow Types:
- **可选 (optional)**: If this action was NOT performed, give a score of 0.0 but note in your explanation that it is optional and does not affect the overall score. If it WAS performed, score normally.
- **条件分支 (conditional)**: This action belongs to a conditional branch. Only evaluate whether this specific branch's action was performed. If the actual scenario did not require this branch (e.g., the fault type was different), a score of 0.0 is acceptable and should be explained as "此分支未触发" (this branch was not triggered).
- **循环 (loop)**: This action is part of a loop. Evaluate whether the loop body was executed, and if the number of executions falls within the expected range. If executed the expected number of times, score 1.0. If executed but fewer times than expected, score 0.5. If not executed at all, score 0.0.
